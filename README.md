# PIAPS2E
PIAPS2E Is an Accurate PlayStation 2 Emulator

## Freindly reminder
This project is like extremely low priority compared to my other projects. It's also still in its infancy.
If anyone starts asking via issues why `this` can't play `that` yet, i will close these issues instantly.
If you just want to play your ps2 games then use `Play!` or `PCSX2`, if you want accuracy then your in the right place.
As `dolphin` devs have said before, `Emulating crashes is also emulation`. 

## FAQ

### What programming language will this be in?
C or C++. At the moment its still undecided.

### What makes this emulator different from the rest of the inaccurate peices of junk that exists for ps2 emulation?
PIAPS2E will emulate a ps2 all the way down to hardware faults. It will NOT be focused on "making games work".

### Cool. So how can i help?
If you wish to help me then you must join my [discord](https://forum.coldbird.net/viewtopic.php?f=2&t=2185) and message me when i'm online. Only people with Advanced knowledge of how a PS2 works and that are serious about helping will be allowed to help in this project.

### What happens if i don't meet the requirements to help?
Tough.

### How will you know about my PS2 knowledge?
You will find that out after you message me.

### What literary language will i need to know to help?
If you can read this then you are fine. Translation/Multilingual versions will be created later.

Yes. We will start out with linux then move to android, windows, mac, ios and others.
